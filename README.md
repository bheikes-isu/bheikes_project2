Dress for the Weather is an application that helps users plan their outfit based on the weather.  They simply enter their location and then they recieve a sample outfit that is well-suited for that day's temperature.  
This uses Python 13 and requires an API code such as OpenAI.  

Step 1: Install requirements: in terminal run the command "pip3 install requirements.txt"
